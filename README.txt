I queried the JSON data in the JSON file to build my game state.

On the game.html page the both user, and computer grid display the
data that is in the JSON file for each player. It will update as
the data changes. If you change the ocean square to a miss it will update
on whichever players table you changed. This data will also be displayed on
the Json Data page. It will also update dynamicall as changes are made to
the game.json file.
