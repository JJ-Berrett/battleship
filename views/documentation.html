    <h1>Implementation</h1>
    <p>I choose battleship because of some of the complexities of the game. Building the game
        and in this project I have used local storage, objects, html audio, recursion and 2d arrays to
        get the game stat that is required. It took a lot of trial and error getting the onClick functions to find attach the computer. The most difficult yet most satisifying
        part of this project was creating the computer AI. Making it smart enough to look at squares in the vicinity when a hit was found.
    </p>
    <p>I tried to figure out how to randomly place the ships in the grid but was unable to figure it out without the ships going out of bounds.
