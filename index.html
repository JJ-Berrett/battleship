        <p>Users will be able to play battleship online against a computer AI. Battleship is a game of strategy and luck.
            Users will place their ships in the ocean on a spacial grid representing coordinates of the ships. Once all
            the ships have been placed the user will then choose a coordinate to launch missiles at.
            If the user hits the opponates ship the square will be red, if not it will be yellow. A basic history of the
            game battleship can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)"

    <h2>Software Design</h2>
    <h3>Game</h3>
    <p>Player wil be facing a computer for the game of battle ship,
    the computers ships will be randomly placed, the user will be able to
    choose where they want their ships place</p>
    <h3>Ships Object</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>shipID: Unique id for ship</li>
        <li>type: ship type. Example: Carrier</li>
        <li>size: How big the ship is</li>
        <li>orientation: Vertical or Horizontal, Position the ship is oriented.</li>
        <li>hits: How many times the ship has been hit</li>
        <li>maxHits: Amount of hits before the ship is sunk</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>tableStates object</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>blanks: 0</li>
        <li>hit: 6</li>
        <li>miss: 7</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Table Array</h3>
    <p>2D array with columns and rows for the table</p>
    <h2>Functions/Methods</h2>
    <h3>createTableArray(height, width)</h3>
    <p>Table constructor that creates a table array setting all values to 0</p>
    <h3>placeShip(shipName, orientation, coordinates)</h3>
    <p>Sets the ship in the table array based off of id and coordinates</p>
    <h3>checkIfHit(coordinates)</h3>
    <p>Checks to see if the coordnates contain a ship and calls the ship hit func or sets the square to missed state</p>
    <h3>hitShip(coordinates)</h3>
    <p>Finds ship in array of ships, increments hits on object, changes square to hit state</p>
    <h3>UpdateTable()</h3>
    <p>Updates the table to the table array after events happen. (hit, miss)</p>
